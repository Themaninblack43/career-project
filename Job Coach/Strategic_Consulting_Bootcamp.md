## 1) What Strategic Consulting Actually Is (1 page)

**Scope (what you sell)**  
Clarify problems, frame opportunities, and recommend **decisions** and **designs** (process, org, product, GTM). Typical lanes: Strategy (where to play/how to win), Operating model, Process redesign, Growth & retention, Portfolio/prioritization, Metrics.

**Typical engagements**
- **Diagnostic (2–4 weeks):** assess current state, identify root causes, prioritize fixes.
- **Redesign/Sprint (3–6 weeks):** co‑design target state and implementation plan.
- **Advisory (monthly):** cadence of reviews, decision support, and risk surfacing.

**Day‑to‑day activities**
- Define problem & success metrics; map stakeholders.
- Interview, shadow, and review artifacts/data.
- Build issue trees & hypotheses; collect just‑enough evidence.
- Synthesize: write memos, build structured slides, recommend actions.
- Facilitate workshops; align on trade‑offs; set next steps.

**Core deliverables**
- **Problem Frame:** context, goals, constraints, scope.
- **Issue Tree & Hypotheses:** decision logic + evidence plan.
- **Findings & Implications:** what’s true + why it matters.
- **Options & Recommendation:** ranked, with risks/assumptions.
- **Roadmap / Operating Model:** who does what, when, how measured.

**What “good” looks like**  
**Clear** (plain language, headlines that say the “so what”), **structured** (MECE‑ish), **evidence‑weighted** (triangulated, honest limits), and **actionable** (owners, next steps, metrics). Stakeholders nod because they see themselves in the work; decisions get made; the next meeting is obvious.

## 4) Practice Projects (3) — portfolio‑ready, tuned to your strengths

> Treat each “input packet” as if a client handed it to you. Ship a **1‑pager or 8–10 slide PDF** and publish to your portfolio.

### Project 1 — Pattern Audit: Growth Plateau
**Strength:** pattern recognition  
**Input packet (fictional SaaS, 1 year):**
```
MRR: 60k→62k→63k→63k→64k→64k→64k→65k→65k→65k→65k→66k
New MRR/mo: 8k,8k,7k,7k,7k,7k,6k,6k,6k,6k,6k,6k
Churn MRR/mo: 6k,6k,6k,7k,7k,7k,7k,7k,7k,6k,6k,5k
Onboarding drop-off: 42%, 41%, 40%, 39%, 38%, 38%, 37%, 37%, 36%, 36%, 35%, 35%
Sales cycle (days): 24→35 over 6 months
ICP split: SMB 80%, Mid 20%; NRR: SMB 96%, Mid 108%
```
**Steps:** Issue tree; hypotheses; low‑effort charts (MRR bridge; funnel; cycle time); 3 findings + 3 implications; 2 options (e.g., Mid‑market push vs. Onboarding fix first).  
**Artifact:** 8–10 slide deck with an executive summary.

### Project 2 — Systems Redesign: Customer Onboarding
**Strength:** systems architecture  
**Input packet:** 6 handoffs; 3 tools (CRM, ticketing, e‑signature); SLA goal ≤14 days (avg 29); failure modes: missing data at kickoff; unclear owner for Step 3; late billing activation.  
**Steps:** Current state map (6–8 boxes); root cause table; redesign (3 handoffs; RACI; Minimum Data Set form); 30‑60‑90 rollout + metrics.  
**Artifact:** 1‑pager + process map image.

## 8) Client‑Acquisition Playbook

**Positioning**  
“I help mid‑size teams **see the system**, surface the few constraints that matter, and design practical fixes in 90 days or less.”

**30‑sec credibility script**  
“I’m a systems‑first strategy consultant. I do quick diagnostics to pinpoint where flow breaks—then design light‑lift changes that move the metric you care about. Recent work: onboarding redesigns, support backlog triage, and growth plateau audits. If you’re open to a short pattern check, I’ll tell you in 30 minutes whether there’s an obvious constraint to tackle.”

**Discovery call flow (30–45 min)**  
Open (purpose/time/outcome) → Context (trigger, must‑be‑true, when) → Current system (walk the flow; stall points) → Evidence (data, prior attempts, constraints, politics) → Value (impact of fixing/not) → Next step (diagnostic or artifact request).

**Outreach plan (20 targets/week)**  
Targets: operators/heads (Ops, CS, RevOps, Plant, Product) at 50–500 FTE orgs in 2–3 niches. Sources: LinkedIn, alumni, niche Slack/Discord, industry newsletters, “we’re hiring” signals.  
Cadence: Mon list 20 • Tue/Wed send 10 notes • Thu send 10 + 5 warm intro asks • Fri follow‑ups + 1 short insight post.  
Metrics: touch→reply ≥10%; reply→call ≥30%; call→proposal ≥30%.

**Free 30‑min pattern analysis — call outline**  
0–5 frame → 5–15 flow map + stalls → 15–25 pattern diagnosis → 25–30 recommend next step (diagnostic) + DIY checklist.

**Sample cold note (≤100 words)**  
“Noticed <signal: hiring 5 CSMs while onboarding time ↑>. I do quick diagnostics to find the 1–2 system constraints that move the metric. If there’s nothing obvious, I’ll say so. If there is, I’ll outline a 90‑day fix. Open to a 30‑min pattern check next week?”

## 12) Risk & Recovery

| Failure Mode | Early Symptom | Recovery Move |
|---|---|---|
| Scope creep | “One more thing…” | Point to scope; log change; price it |
| Weak problem statement | Meetings meander | Re‑frame in writing; confirm by email |
| Analysis paralysis | Too many tabs | Timebox; test top hypothesis first |
| No next step | Quiet endings | Always end with owner/date/metric |
| Stakeholder ghosting | Slipped meetings | Value summary + choices; escalate |
| Politics blocks change | Side chats, turf talk | Map incentives; re‑frame benefits per function |
| Data unavailable | “We don’t track that” | Proxy metrics; sample; benchmark ranges |
| Over‑customized solution | Fragile, hard to run | Minimum viable change; pilot & learn |
| Underpricing | Resentment/overwork | Use price grid; enforce change control |
| Deck sprawl | 40 slides, no point | 1‑page memo first; then deck |

---

## 13) Templates (copy/paste)

**A) Problem Frame (1 page)**  
Context • Goal & metric • Stakeholders & constraints • Scope (in/out) • Risks/unknowns • Decision needed by.

**B) Interview Guide (skeleton)**  
Purpose → Opener → 6–8 open questions → Probes → Closer (“Anything else?”) → Consent to quote anonymized.

**C) Weekly Update (email body)**  
Progress • Findings (top 3) • Risks/blocks • Next week plan • Asks.

**D) Proposal Shell**  
Situation & Objective → Deliverables → Approach & Timeline → Client inputs → Team & Cadence → Price & Terms → Risks & Assumptions → Acceptance criteria → Change request process.

---

## 14) Weekly Reflection Prompts
**What I produced** (link) • **What I learned** (1–3 bullets) • **Evidence I’m ready to advance** (tie to rubrics).

---

## 15) AI Integration — micro‑workflows (Weeks 9–10)
Interview→Notes→Synthesis (record + auto‑summarize + quote tags) • Deck headline drafts • Data sanity checks.  
**Guardrails:** you own judgment; cite limits; do not paste client secrets into external tools without consent.

---

## 16) Thought Leadership Seeds (Week 10)
Format: 400–700 words, 1 chart, 1 checklist.  
Topics: “Three patterns behind B2B onboarding delays”, “How to spot a real bottleneck in 20 minutes”.

---

## 17) Quick How‑Tos (mini‑examples where beginners get lost)

**Issue Tree micro‑example**
```
Growth plateau
├─ Acquisition ↓ (lead quality, channel)
├─ Conversion ↓ (onboarding friction)
└─ Churn ↑ (poor fit, weak activation)
```
Pick one leaf → write hypothesis → test with one cheap piece of evidence.

**Chart hygiene micro‑example**  
If headline reads “Hand‑offs cause 61% stalls,” show a **bar** with stalls by step, sorted, Step 3 first.

**Pricing talk opener**  
“Given your objective and timeline, the diagnostic is a fixed **$3,000** and takes 3 weeks. If we scope a sprint after that, I’ll give you two options based on effort.” *(Then pause.)*

---

## 18) Your Repeatable Client‑Acquisition Loop (one‑page)

1) Pick **2 niches** you enjoy.  
2) Weekly **pattern post** (problem → tell → first fix).  
3) **20 targeted touches/week** (signal + short note).  
4) Offer **30‑min pattern check**; convert 30–40% to diagnostic.  
5) Run the **diagnostic well**; 50–70% convert to sprint/advisory.  
6) Ask for **testimonial** and **warm intro** on delivery.  
7) Track metrics; raise prices when thresholds met.

---
