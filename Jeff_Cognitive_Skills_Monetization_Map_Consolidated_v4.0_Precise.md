# Jeff's Cognitive Skills · Monetization Map v4.1 — Precise Edition
## **CONSOLIDATED: CURRENT SKILLS + RESEARCH POTENTIAL**

---

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Jeff’s highest-value capabilities are systems analysis, pattern detection in noisy contexts, cross-domain synthesis, and technical troubleshooting/integration. These map cleanly to independent consulting and productized services. Evidence is drawn from Jeff’s artifacts and chat exports (paths listed where applicable). Ranges below reflect common market benchmarks, not guarantees.

## **PART 1: CURRENT MONETIZABLE SKILLS**
*Derived from documented work and message exports*

### **1. Pattern Recognition & Systems Analysis**
- **Skill**: Identify recurring failure modes, root causes, and second-order effects; propose pragmatic redesigns.
- **Evidence**: `C:\Cid\chat_exports_md\2025-06-11 - Pattern recognition and perception.md`
- **Applications**:
  - Process diagnostics and redesign (ops, product, GTM).
  - Strategic planning with explicit assumptions and risks.
- **Benchmarks**: $150–$400/hr independent; higher with references.

### **2. Cross-Domain Synthesis / Framework Design**
- **Skill**: Unify concepts across domains into usable models and checklists.
- **Evidence**: `C:\Cid\chat_exports_md\2025-06-19 - Information Gravity Summary.md`
- **Applications**:
  - Method/tool creation for decision-making, prioritization, and risk control.
  - Training internal teams on standardized approaches.
- **Benchmarks**: $100–$300/hr consulting; product revenue variable.

### **3. Technical Problem-Solving & Integration**
- **Skill**: Systematic troubleshooting; integrate tools/data; create working prototypes/simulations.
- **Evidence**: `C:\Cid\chat_exports_md\2025-06-19 - Factorio Proofs in Mathematica.md`
- **Applications**:
  - Data/toolchain integration; migration planning; reliability fixes.
  - Before/after performance improvements with written runbooks.
- **Benchmarks**: $100–$250/hr; fixed-fee packages common.

### **4. Mental Model Integration**
- **Skill**: Curate and combine models (constraints, incentives, feedback loops) into practical playbooks.
- **Evidence**: Portfolio notes and prior briefs.
- **Applications**:
  - Org decision frameworks; risk review templates; onboarding guides.
- **Benchmarks**: $100–$250/hr; workshop formats viable.

## **PART 2: RESEARCH/DEVELOPMENT TRACKS (EMERGING)**
*Not yet consistently monetized; keep as parallel R&D*

### **A. Formal Framework Development**
- **Focus**: Formalizing conceptual models with testable claims and simple demos.
- **Evidence**: `C:\Cid\chat_exports_md\2025-06-19 - Free Will Proof Code.md` (method work-in-progress).
- **Monetization When Mature**:
  - Method licensing, advanced workshops, research collaborations.
- **Est. Timeline**: 6–18 months depending on prototype quality.

### **B. Constraint Network Analysis (Advanced)**
- **Focus**: Mapping multi-constraint systems to expose bottlenecks/trade-offs.
- **Monetization When Mature**:
  - High-end advisory for complex org/process redesigns.
- **Est. Timeline**: Proof via 2–3 real engagements with measurable results.

## **PART 3: IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1: Monetize Current Skills (0–6 months)**
- Build 5–7 briefs: problem → analysis → intervention → outcome → artifact link.
- Define two service offerings: (1) Systems Diagnostic (fixed-scope), (2) Integration/Debugging Sprint.
- Target 20 prospects; send 2–3 tailored outreaches/week with relevant brief attached.
- Land 2 paid pilots (20–40 hours each) with explicit success criteria.

### **Phase 2: Consolidate & Productize (6–12 months)**
- Convert repeated work into checklists/templates; publish concise case studies with metrics.
- Raise rates aligned to proof; add fixed-fee packages with clear inclusions/exclusions.

### **Phase 3: R&D to Market (9–18 months)**
- Prototype formal frameworks into demos/tools; pilot with one client willing to co-develop.
- Evaluate licensing and workshop options; keep core IP modular.

## **TOTAL POTENTIAL (INDICATIVE)**
- **Current skills only**: ~$150k–$400k/year depending on utilization and rates.
- **With productization + references**: ~$250k–$600k/year.
- **With mature R&D offers**: potentially higher; depends on proof and distribution.

## **SOURCING NOTES**
- Evidence paths reference Jeff’s local chat export files. Market ranges reflect common independent consulting benchmarks and are not guarantees. This document favors verifiable artifacts and repeatable methods over expansive claims.
