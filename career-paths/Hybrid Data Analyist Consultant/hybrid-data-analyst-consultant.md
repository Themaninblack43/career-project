# Hybrid Path: Data Analyst + Constraint Consultant Dossier

## 1. Snapshot
- **Structure:** Remote data analyst role for stability + evening/weekend consulting sprints.
- **Ideal Jeff Strengths:** Analytical rigor, storytelling, constraint diagnosis, client rapport.
- **Why It Works:** Job sharpens technical chops; consulting monetizes insights with higher leverage.

## 2. Lifestyle & Capacity Planning
- **Day Job:** 30–35 hrs core workload; negotiate async schedules.
- **Consulting Cadence:** 10 hrs/week max; 1 client at a time for deep focus.
- **Energy Watchpoints:** Prevent burnout by batching consulting work on fixed days; maintain recovery rituals.

## 3. Skills & Tool Stack
- **Shared:** SQL, dashboards, Loom storytelling, ROI calculators.
- **Job-Specific:** Product analytics, experimentation, data modeling.
- **Consulting-Specific:** Discovery interviews, proposal writing, constraint frameworks.
- **Tool Synergy:** Use job’s stack templates as case studies (sanitize data) for consulting marketing.

## 4. Market & Demand
- **Day Job:** Same as Data Analyst dossier—abundant remote roles.
- **Consulting:** Founders crave actionable analytics + constraint insights; retainer potential high.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Ensure employer contract allows moonlighting; maintain separate client tools.

## 5. Income Model
- **Salary Baseline:** $70K–$95K remote data analyst.
- **Consulting Add-On:** $500 audits → $2K engagements → $500/month retainers.
- **Goal:** Reach $2K/month side income within 6 months; evaluate full-time consulting viability.

## 6. Entry Strategy
- Secure data analyst role with growth-friendly company (remote-first SaaS).
- Build anonymized case study from day job wins (show impact baseline → improved metric).
- Launch “Metrics + Constraint” audit service highlighting unique hybrid view.
- Cross-promote: share insights via newsletter, Slack communities.

## 7. Weekly Operating Rhythm
| Day | Job Focus | Consulting Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mon | Job metrics, sprint planning | Prep consult tasks |
| Tue | Deep analysis | Client discovery calls |
| Wed | Present findings | No consulting (rest/research) |
| Thu | Experiment follow-up | Build deliverables |
| Fri | Wrap job tasks | Deliver Loom/updates |
| Sat/Sun | Light admin or rest | Optional workshop/session |

## 8. Challenges & Mitigation
- **Time Conflicts:** Use calendar blocks; communicate availability to clients.
- **Context Switching:** Keep separate Notion workspaces; nightly review to reset.
- **Employer Restrictions:** Review contract; if needed, disclose high-level consulting focus without client names.

## 9. Lead Sources & Employers
- **Employers (Day Job):** Remote-first SaaS via Otta/Wellfound, analytics agencies (Causal, GrowthLoop), product-led companies advertising “remote data analyst.”
- **Consulting Channels:** Indie Hackers analytics threads, RevOps Slack, Modern Data Stack communities, alumni network newsletters, r/smallbusiness “help wanted” posts.
- **Freelance Platforms:** Upwork (metrics revamp), Contra, Growth Collective, Pangea.ai.
- **Referral Flywheel:** Present wins internally, request warm intros to partner companies; offer “Metrics & Constraint Checkup” to their peers; share sanitized case studies on newsletter.

## 10. Money Loop Experiments
- Bundle $300 “Metrics & Constraint Mini-Audit” to test pricing.
- Offer recurring KPI stand-ups for $200/month (async Loom recaps).
- Run quarterly workshop “Use Your Data to Find the One Bottleneck” ($149 seat).

## 11. Notes & Next Steps
- Track energy/resonance after each hybrid week; adjust workload ratio.
- Build compliance checklist (NDAs, data separation, time tracking).
- Evaluate path after 6 months: continue hybrid, transition to full consulting, or pivot class.
