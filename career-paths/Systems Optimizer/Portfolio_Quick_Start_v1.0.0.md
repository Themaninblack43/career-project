## Projects

### Gmail Starred Email Tracker

**Tools:** Zapier, Gmail, Google Sheets  
**Date:** October 18, 2025

**Problem:** No organized way to track important starred emails.

**Solution:** Automation captures every starred email to a Google Sheet automatically.

**Results:**
- Saves 5 minutes/day (30 hours/year)
- Zero emails lost
- Better follow-up tracking

**How it works:**
1. Star email in Gmail
2. Zapier detects and extracts email data
3. Adds row to Google Sheet automatically
