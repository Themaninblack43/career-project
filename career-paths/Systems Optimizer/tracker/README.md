# Systems Optimizer Tracker Template

Import these CSVs into Airtable (one table per file) or any spreadsheet tool. They mirror the roadmap's tracking needs.

## Tables

1. **weeks_and_sprints.csv** – week-by-week plan, energy ratings, adjustments.
2. **automations.csv** – every build with safety fields, SLO metrics, evidence links.
3. **templates_and_assets.csv** – template library with status tags.
4. **pipeline.csv** – outreach + sales funnel staged flow.
5. **financials.csv** – invoices, pricing, tool-cost allocation.
6. **skills_inventory.csv** – skill ratings with proof and next improvement step.

### Suggested Airtable Views
- Kanban weeks by `Status`.
- Automation safety filter (`Kill Switch Implemented? = No`).
- Pipeline grouped by `Stage`.
- Revenue vs. tool cost chart from financials.
- Skills radar chart via Airtable Interfaces if desired.

Update each table weekly to keep the roadmap grounded in actual data.
