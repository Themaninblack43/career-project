can yoou read everything and then look at the .html file? trying to get that sort of working


Tab switching works now; each button passes the click event and I added a safe fallback so the active tab highlights correctly (career-rpg-game.html:286-289, career-rpg-game.html:684-704).
Filled out quest-line data for every class card, so the info panel no longer goes blank when you pick Tech PM, BI Developer, hybrid paths, etc. (career-rpg-game.html:600-681).
Class selection resets cleanly when you change tabs and keeps track of the last pick; the info panel shows a default prompt until you pick something (career-rpg-game.html:684-759).
Open career-rpg-game.html in your browser to see the updated RPG selector; try each tab and class to confirm the new quest details render. If you want to add audio, sprites, or persistence, let me know which upgrade we should tackle next.

i added a .md to the folder named career-game-design-doc.md. read it and let me know what you think


Love how the doc anchors the whole project in clear problems and a phased loop; it gives us a solid north star for the MVP (career-game-design-doc.md:8, career-game-design-doc.md:25).
Data structures for character stats/quests are already sketched in code form (career-game-design-doc.md:52, career-game-design-doc.md:87), which will translate straight into JSON/LocalStorage when we wire up the browser app.
A few tweaks that would make implementation even smoother:

Phase 1 scope – add acceptance criteria for each block in the core loop, so we know when “quest system” or “progress tracking” is considered shippable (career-game-design-doc.md:25).
Stat economy – spell out ranges/caps and regeneration rules for Energy/Focus/Gold so the balance doesn’t drift once we start awarding XP (career-game-design-doc.md:58).
Quest lifecycle – note how quests are unlocked, expired, or repeated, and what happens when a user partially completes one (career-game-design-doc.md:87).
Save data schema – since we’re leaning on LocalStorage, a quick outline of the save-game JSON (including streaks, achievements, personalization) would help keep UI/modules in sync.
Integration plan – jot down how this doc maps onto the existing 16-bit selector page: which sections become panels, what new screens we’ll need, and what gets reused.
If you want, I can turn this into issues or a checklist we can burn down from the current HTML prototype.

make a big check list for me


 Align on MVP scope: confirm Phase 1 loop (character → class → quests → tracking → rewards) and define done criteria for each module.

 Draft data schema: outline LocalStorage save structure for character, quests, resources, achievements, streaks, settings.

 Nail stat economy: set numeric ranges, regen rates, and depletion rules for energy, focus, gold, reputation.

 Map UI screens: sketch wireframes covering dashboard, quest log, class progression, inventory/achievements, weekly report.

 Validate accessibility: list ADHD/autism accommodations per screen and how UI reinforces them.

 Prioritize audio/visual polish backlog so core loop ships before cosmetic upgrades.

 Flesh out character creator: capture profile inputs, auto-seed stats from existing cognitive profile, allow manual tweak with guardrails.

 Implement leveling logic: XP thresholds, level-up flow, skill-point allocation, unlock notifications.

 Design resource HUD: always-visible energy/focus/gold bars with tooltips, low-resource warnings, recover actions.

 Define achievements library: milestones, rewards, badge art placeholders, stacking rules.

 Plan avatar system: decide on static sprite vs. customizable layers, tie outfits to achievements.

 Draft onboarding tutorial: guided first session showcasing class selection, completing a quest, reviewing progress.

 Build quest taxonomy: daily, weekly, epic, random encounter templates with required inputs and cooldown rules.

 Author starter quest pack: populate at least 10 daily, 6 weekly, 3 epic quests from design doc examples.

 Create quest chain logic: dependencies, branching outcomes, failure/reset handling.

 Design quest board UI: filters by type, progress indicators, hover reveals tasks/rewards.

 Implement quest tracking: mark subtasks, partial completion saves, streak bonuses.

 Add “press start” CTA linking from class cards into appropriate first quest.

 Extend class data: translate design doc entries into JSON (requirements, evolution tree, special ability, quest hooks).

 Wire class selection: integrate existing 16-bit selector with new data to trigger quest bundles and stat modifiers.

 Build evolution view: tree visualization showing prerequisites, projected rewards, future quests.

 Support multi-classing: rules for hybrid unlocks, XP split, balancing perks.

 Add class-specific UI flair: unique color accents or icons per class path.

 Document balancing notes for future tuning cycles.

 Implement save/load manager: auto-save cadence, manual save slots, cloud-ready abstraction.

 Add backup/export: allow JSON download/upload to prevent LocalStorage loss.

 Include daily reset job: refresh quests, regenerate resources, roll random encounters.

 Build weekly report generator: summary card mirroring design doc layout with trend stats.

 Integrate notifications: toast system for XP gain, level ups, low energy, achievements.

 Draft analytics/tracking log to review usage (even if local only).

 Prepare testing checklist: cover quest flows, save/load, stat updates, edge cases (energy zero, rapid level ups).

 Create content pipeline doc: how to add new quests, classes, rewards without touching core code.

 Set up art/sound backlog: sprite needs, audio cues, priority order, sources or commissioning plan.

 Outline future systems: economy expansion (shops, gear), social features, mobile wrapper.

 Plan feedback loop: weekly self-review prompts, adjustments to quests/goals based on friction.

 Define success metrics and dashboards to ensure the game actually drives real-world progress.

here are perplexities recommendations in an atachment


The Perplexity summary aligns neatly with what we scoped: it doubles down on clear progress tracking, tight quest loops, and accessibility accommodations already in career-game-design-doc.md—nice confirmation we’re on the right track.
Biggest gaps it exposes for us: we still need wireframes/info toggles for dense class data, explicit onboarding copy tying game stats to real-world actions, and a plan for streak bonuses/random encounters to keep things dynamic (career-game-design-doc.md, career-rpg-game.html).
Let me know if you want me to turn those missing pieces into concrete tasks or mockups next.
no lets start reallly small and 1 step at a time. focusing on classes, what would it look like if i selected it and went to the next menu, like operations analyist for example


Selecting OPERATIONS ANALYST today just highlights the card and fills the info panel on the right (career-rpg-game.html:315, career-rpg-game.html:724). To turn that into a “next menu” while keeping scope tiny, here’s what I’d build next:

Primary action button inside the info panel: after the quest details, add a chunky > ENTER OPS QUESTLINE button. Clicking it swaps the main grid for a dedicated Operations view.
Dedicated Ops screen (can reuse the same area where the class grid sits):
Top banner: class icon + name + difficulty + short flavor text.
Quest list: three cards for “First Week”, “First Month”, “Boss Fight” with tasks/XP bars.
Starter loadout: small panel for recommended tools (e.g., Excel, SQL cheatsheet, community links).
Progress meters: simple bars for “Applications sent”, “Process maps completed”, etc., seeded to zero.
Back control: pixel-style ⮐ Back to Class Selection in the upper-left so you can return without losing state.
Keep data static for the first pass—hardcode the Ops quests we already wrote at career-game-design-doc.md:300.
If that matches what you picture, I can wire up the button and the bare-bones Ops screen next.

yeah we will need to do that i guess it needs to keep track of skills and stuff...can you just mae te mock up of the op analyist one so i can see it? i might want to keep going ion that


Added a full-page Operations Analyst “questline” mock-up with dedicated styles, cards, and meters so the deep-dive feels like its own RPG screen (career-rpg-game.html:226-380, career-rpg-game.html:845-936).
Wired the class info panel to surface an ▶ ENTER OPERATIONS ANALYST QUESTLINE button and open the new view while hiding the tabs grid for focus (career-rpg-game.html:968-1019, career-rpg-game.html:1026-1039).
Dropped in a back button that restores the original selector and keeps your prior class selection intact (career-rpg-game.html:853, career-rpg-game.html:1042-1051).
Open career-rpg-game.html in a browser, click Operations Analyst, and hit the new questline button to walk through the mock.

Next step idea: hook those progress meters to placeholder data or temp inputs so you can test how the layout reacts before wiring real tracking.

ok now do systems optimizer


Added a fully themed Systems Optimizer deep-dive view with quest chain, loadout, progress meters, and unlocks, matching the RPG vibe (career-rpg-game.html:948).
Flagged the Systems Optimizer class as having a detail view so the info panel now shows the “enter questline” CTA alongside the new content (career-rpg-game.html:764).
The shared detail-view toggles still apply, so the same back button collapses the mock and returns you to the class grid without losing selection (career-rpg-game.html:1028, career-rpg-game.html:1042).
Open career-rpg-game.html, pick Systems Optimizer, hit the questline button, and you’ll see the mock. Want me to tackle the Constraint Hunter next or pause to hook these meters up to actual data?

these are all so different, and just thinking about them as career options, i dont know what to pick ..but i guess thats why im making this thing. But i just have no idea


Totally get it—when every class looks cool in its own way, the meta-choice becomes the real boss fight. Since you’re building this specifically to make that choice less paralyzing, use the system itself as your decision engine:

Turn “Which class?” into a quick quest chain

Quest 1: Run a 3-day micro-playtest per class. For Ops Analyst maybe map one process at home; for Systems Optimizer, automate a personal workflow; for Data Analyst, break down a dataset you already have. Note which one energizes you vs. drains you.
Quest 2: Look at “Time to First Loot.” Which class lets you ship a small win fastest—resume tweak, portfolio artifact, $100 gig? That momentum matters more than theoretical ceiling right now.
Quest 3: Check the “fun factor.” After the mini-playtests, rate each class on curiosity, flow state, and how quickly you’d wake up ready to keep going. Ignore salary icons for a moment; pick the path that sparks consistent action.
If you want, I can formalize that into three checklists inside the UI so you can actually log the experiments and see which bar fills up quickest. Or I can help you draft the quest cards for the other classes so you’ve got comparable views before you pick. Just say the word.

i like the idea but before that, i would like to make some mock iterations of changes in the UI. It is too hard to read the way it is. dont change it, just ideas and mocks. do i need a different ui to make the images


User attachment
You can absolutely keep everything in the same HTML file for now; for mock iterations just tweak styles/layout in a throwaway branch or duplicate the section inside your file. A few concepts you could try quickly:

Concept A – Side Panel Layout

Left column: vertical nav with class icon, short fantasy blurb, and a mini badge strip.
Center panel: quest chain only, but accordion-style cards so you see one act at a time.
Right panel: tabs (Loadout | Progress | Unlocks) to reduce the wall of text.
Concept B – Scrollable Sections + Icons

Large header banner with pixel art, then stack sections vertically with bold section icons (⚙️ for loadout, 🗺️ for quests).
Each section framed like a JRPG menu box; add subtle gradients and larger line spacing for readability.
Sticky “Back to class select” button anchored at the top-left.
Concept C – Card Deck

Present each quest/start loadout/progress/unlocks as separate oversized cards arranged in a 2×2 grid; hover flips the card to show details.
Use color-coded borders: yellow for quests, cyan for loadout, purple for progress, etc., to help the eye separate categories.
Add small progress dials instead of long bars for the tracker metrics.
Concept D – Modal Quest Log

Keep the selector background dimmed and open the chosen class inside a centered modal with tabs and pagination.
Tab 1: “Story & Quests”; Tab 2: “Toolkit & Buffs”; Tab 3: “Progress”.
Makes it easier to read on mobile and puts all focus on one section at a time.
For the image iteration in your screenshot, try:

Increasing padding inside each column, bump line-height to ~1.4, and add section headers with a larger font (14–16px) so the eye can quickly parse.
Replace bulleted text with numbered steps inside quest cards; use bold for key verbs only.
Drop thin vertical separators between columns and use a slight background tint difference.
You don’t need a different UI tool to mock this—copy the HTML block into a sandbox page, tweak CSS, and screenshot results. If you’d prefer visual tools, Figma or Penpot can mirror the pixel aesthetic quickly, but sticking to the browser keeps it aligned with what you’ll actually ship.

Want me to draft one of these concepts right in the HTML as a comment or alternate block so you can toggle it on/off?

i dont want to ship anything i just want this as a tool for myself


All good—let’s treat it like a personal sandbox. In that case:

We can keep experimenting right inside the current HTML file, swapping layouts or turning sections on/off as you explore what feels readable. No need to worry about polish or deployability.
I can sketch alternate UI blocks (e.g., Concept A/B/C) as additional HTML/CSS chunks wrapped in comments or toggle-able classes so you can flip between them and screenshot the versions you like.
If you ever want to archive a layout, we can drop it into career-game-design-doc.md or a separate mock file so you don’t lose the idea when you iterate again.
Tell me which concept you want to see mocked first—or describe what your ideal “easy to read” version looks like and I’ll rough it in for you.

lets start with concept A though id like to see them all


Dropped four alternate layout mocks into career-rpg-game.html so you can toggle them on whenever you want to experiment (each block is hidden behind the mock-hidden class):
Concept A: side panel + quest column + info tabs (career-rpg-game.html:340-420, career-rpg-game.html:552-620).
Concept B: vertical scroll with section icons and breathing room (career-rpg-game.html:422-463, career-rpg-game.html:622-662).
Concept C: flip-card grid for quests/loadout/progress/unlocks (career-rpg-game.html:465-508, career-rpg-game.html:664-709).
Concept D: dimmed modal quest log with tab strip (career-rpg-game.html:510-564, career-rpg-game.html:711-752).
Just remove mock-hidden from the container you want to preview and reload; everything else stays untouched.
Next steps if you feel like it: 1) mix-and-match pieces (e.g., Concept B’s spacing with Concept A’s side nav), 2) screen-cap the variations and note readability wins, 3) once a favorite emerges, wire it into the live detail view.

how do o get to those UI now?


Quick toggle steps (all in career-rpg-game.html):

Scroll near the bottom around career-rpg-game.html:552 and you’ll see each mock wrapped like <div class="mock-container mock-hidden" id="concept-a-mock">.
Delete mock-hidden (leave mock-container), save, refresh the page—Concept A will appear right below the existing UI.
Same drill for Concept B, C, or D (career-rpg-game.html:622, career-rpg-game.html:664, career-rpg-game.html:711).
Add mock-hidden back when you want to hide that mock again.
You can have multiple active at once; they stack in the order they’re defined.

regarding these jobs inn real life..which ones are available remotely and have work available


Remote-Friendly & In-Demand Paths

Data Analyst: Strong remote market; tech, healthcare, finance hire globally. Look for “remote” filters on LinkedIn, Indeed, Wellfound, and contract gigs on Upwork/Toptal. Portfolio + SQL/BI samples help.
Business/Operations Analyst: Fewer full-remote than data roles, but growing with distributed SaaS/startups. Target companies with fully remote ops teams (Zapier, GitLab, Automattic). Fractional/contract ops gigs often remote.
QA Engineer: Lots of remote QA (manual + automation) via tech firms and QA outsourcing studios. Check RemoteOK, WeWorkRemotely, Test IO, Rainforest QA for project-based work.
BI Developer / Analytics Engineer: High demand due to modern data stack; many remote and hybrid roles. Look at dbt job board, Locally Optimistic’s listings, and Remote Analytics job boards.
Technical Writer: One of the most remote-able paths. SaaS companies, API platforms, open-source projects routinely hire remote writers. Browse Write the Docs job board, GitLab, Stripe, Redocly, and contract marketplaces.
Product Manager (Tech PM): Remote roles exist but more competitive; easier with experience or specialization. Look at remote-friendly companies and PM contract agencies (Braintrust, A.Team).
Constraint Hunter / Systems Optimizer (Consulting): Entirely remote-friendly if you source clients via indie hacker communities, LinkedIn, or cold outreach. Plenty of founders need process audits and automation help.
Tech Translator / Presales Consultant: Remote options available, often as contract presales/solutions consultants. Many B2B SaaS companies hire remote specialists for sales enablement.
Hybrid Combos (job + consulting) are very viable remotely—day job from remote-friendly employer, side quests delivered via Zoom/async.

How to Validate Availability Quickly

Spend 15 minutes on a remote job board per class; note fresh postings this week.
Check contract platforms (Upwork, Contra, Braintrust) for gigs matching each skill set.
Join relevant communities/Slacks (dbt, Ops Nation, Write the Docs) and scan their #jobs channels.
If you want a daily “remote quest tracker” in the UI, I can wire a section to log job leads per class.

its just so overwhelming and i am worried im gonna learn stuff then not make any money becaus i cant get work


Totally hear you—that fear is real, and it's smart to surface it now instead of powering through and burning out. Let’s keep the “career as a game” framing, but add a money-first loop so you’re never grinding skills for XP alone:

1. Stack two loops, not one

Skill loop (learn/ship/demo): keep it small—one LinkedIn post, one Loom, one mini case study.
Money loop (earn/prove value): every week run a tiny monetization experiment: paid user test, micro-consulting call, Upwork bid, or flat-fee deliverable. Even $50 validates the loop.
2. Prototype with “15-hour sprints”

Pick one class for a 15-hour sprint (over 7 days). Split 60% learn/build, 40% outreach. At the end you must hit one of:
Earn cash (any amount)
Land an interview/meeting
Get a testimonial or warm intro
If not, debrief, adjust, switch class next sprint. Small cycles stop the overwhelm.
3. Reuse your game artifacts as sales tools

The questlines, loadouts, and progress meters become your pitch deck, portfolio, and process doc. Share screenshots or Notion versions with prospects; it shows process mastery and makes you memorable.
4. Warm leads > cold hunting

Tap communities tied to the class you’re testing (Ops Nation, Write the Docs, Indie Hackers, etc.) and post “free/cheap audit” offers. A constraint audit or automation session is a fast ticket to paid work.
Pair this with LinkedIn DMs reusing a template: highlight physics/system thinking + specific problem you solve.
5. Track “energy vs. response”
After each experiment, log:

Energy cost (1–5)
Outcome (cash/interview/lead/none)
Enjoyment (1–5)
Patterns will reveal the class that pays and fits quicker than theory.
If it helps, I can wire a tiny “Money Loop Tracker” panel in the UI so you can record each experiment outcome and see trends. Or we can script out your first 15-hour sprint together. Just say where you want to start.

i hate linkedin so much....and my account was hacked too so i have to get it back...god its just so fake and revolting


LinkedIn can feel like a slog even when your account isn’t compromised, so it makes sense you’re frustrated. You do have other ways to build pipeline while you sort the hack out—or even skip LinkedIn entirely if it keeps draining you.

Immediate triage (15‑minute quest)

File the “account hacked” report (linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-NFT) so recovery runs in the background.
Meanwhile, lock down anything that reused that password and toss a quick note in your planner: if support drags past two weeks, decide whether to re-engage or leave it dormant.
Alternative networking paths that aren’t LinkedIn

Specialist communities (Slack/Discord): Ops Nation, Locally Optimistic, Write the Docs, dbt Community, Indie Hackers, r/consulting. These feel more like peer hangouts than a feed of humblebrags.
Targeted forums / subreddits: r/smallbusiness, r/startups, or niche forums tied to the class you’re exploring. Offer constraint audits, automation tips, or case breakdowns.
Job boards without the performative layer:
Tech/remote: WeWorkRemotely, RemoteOK, JustRemote.
Analytics/ops: Lever’s public boards, Otta, BuiltIn, Braintrust.
Writing: Write the Docs board, ProBlogger, Who Pays Technical Writers.
Automation/freelance: Contra, Upwork (with filtered keywords), Growth Collective.
Direct outreach: build a tiny list (5 per week) of companies with messy systems (hint: mention they ship fast but ops lag). Email a short loom video or PDF using your RPG framing—unique enough to get replies.
Collaborations: guest session in a relevant community, offer a free workshop, partner with indie founders who need ops/data help (try Twitter/Reddit or Cold Email Wizard style outreach).
Make it game-sized so it’s manageable

Treat “find 3 communities that don’t make me cringe” as a quest. Once you’re in, post one value drop or answer a question—no profile optimization required.
Align your “Money Loop” experiments with those paths: weekly challenge = “book one audit call from outside LinkedIn.”
If you still want a LinkedIn presence later, you can automate the chore (use a simple scheduler to repost wins or case studies without scrolling the feed). Until then, everything above keeps your momentum (and income potential) without touching the platform.

This is from perplexity regarding thngs i should olook for in a job. can you make one for each of the positions? also make sure to include a section about who my employer/clients would be and where id find them: I have a list of potential careers that I have an aptitude toward, and I am choose one or more to try to make a living. what is the most comprehensive list of things about each of these careers that I should know

To make an informed decision about any career under serious consideration, it is important to conduct a comprehensive evaluation that goes beyond surface-level job titles or salary figures. The following is a thorough list of essential aspects and questions to research for each potential career path before committing:

Core Personal and Lifestyle Fit
Passion and Interest: Does the core work excite and sustain interest? Is there a natural alignment with strengths and preferences?​

Skills and Aptitude: Do current skills (technical, interpersonal, etc.) match the requirements, or is further development needed?​

Personality Fit: Would the daily work environment and culture match personality traits, work style, and preferred level of structure or independence?​

Work-Life Balance: What are the typical work hours, stress levels, remote options, travel demands, and how do these align with lifestyle preferences?​

Core Values: Does the career allow meaningful alignment with personal values (e.g., helping others, creativity, social impact, autonomy, stability)?​

Structural and Economic Factors
Job Market and Demand: What is the current and future demand for the career? What is the outlook based on industry trends and automation risk?​

Compensation and Benefits: What are the salary ranges at different experience levels? What is the potential for raises, bonuses, health care, retirement, and other benefits?​

Job Security: How stable are jobs in this field? Is job security high, or does it depend on market cycles or short-term contracts?​

Geographic/Remote Flexibility: Where are the jobs located? Are remote roles available, or does success require relocation?​

Education, Training, and Career Path
Education and Certification: What degrees, licenses, or credentials are required or common? Is there ongoing professional development, and does it demand significant investment (money, time)?​

Entry Barriers: What experience, internships, or apprenticeships are expected for beginners? How competitive is entry?​

Advancement: What does a typical career progression look like? Are there opportunities for rapid growth, specialization, or moving into leadership?​

Role-Specific Exploration
Daily Responsibilities: What are the core day-to-day tasks? Is there a typical workday, or does it vary seasonally/project-to-project?​

Key Challenges and Stressors: What are the most difficult or demanding aspects? What kind of problems recur regularly?​

Required Skills: Are there essential technical, analytical, or “soft” skills unique to success in this role? Is ongoing learning vital?​

Workplace Culture and Environment: Is the field typically collaborative, competitive, hierarchical, or flat? How formal or creative is the common setting?​

Experience and Reality Checks
Talk to Professionals: Network with people currently in the field for real-world insights and advice, if possible conduct informational interviews or shadowing.​

Entry Experiences: What do entry-level positions look like, and do they provide a realistic path to the more desirable roles?​

Pros and Cons: What are the best and worst parts according to those actually in the field?​

Growth and Satisfaction
Professional Development: Does the field offer ongoing opportunities for learning, new responsibilities, and skill upgrades?​

Fulfillment and Impact: Can the work lead to a sense of accomplishment, making a difference, or supporting a mission or community?​

Long-Term Prospects: Where do experienced professionals usually end up? Is it feasible and desirable to remain in this field over the long term (financially and personally)?​

Consider using a spreadsheet or checklist to compare each career across these factors as objectively as possible. Prioritization among these categories will help ensure the choice aligns with both immediate needs and long-term satisfaction.​

Want a template spreadsheet or to embed this comparison into the RPG UI? I can draft either next.

i was hoping to get proper files made. one for each. that we could then build out till it had all the needed info


Created a dedicated career-paths/ directory and drafted standalone dossiers for every class in your RPG selector—covering traditional roles (data-analyst.md, operations-analyst.md, qa-engineer.md, tech-product-manager.md, bi-developer.md, technical-writer.md), consulting tracks (constraint-hunter-consultant.md, systems-optimizer.md, tech-translator.md), and hybrid paths (hybrid-data-analyst-consultant.md, hybrid-ops-analyst-optimizer.md). Each file carries the full checklist: personal fit, skills, market outlook, compensation, entry strategy, growth path, challenges, employer/client sources, and “money loop” experiments.

Next move suggestions:

Pick one dossier to expand with personal notes (energy scores, interest level).
Add a master index or spreadsheet to compare the dossiers side-by-side.
Connect a chosen dossier back into the game UI, so selecting a class can open its file or summary panel.

systems optimizer ...breakdown what that does in more depth, the job itself i mean


Expanded the Systems Optimizer dossier with a “Deep Role Breakdown” section that walks through each stage of the job—stack recon, diagnosis, solution architecture, build/integrate, QA, enablement, and ongoing monitoring—so you’ve got a clear picture of the day-to-day flow (career-paths/systems-optimizer.md:12-19). Let me know if you want a sample weekly schedule or deliverable checklist next.

that sounds fulfilling and enjoyable but i dont know how to do most of that suff


Totally fair—this path mixes a bunch of skills that aren’t second nature until you’ve actually done them. The good news: you already think in systems, and you don’t have to learn everything at once. Try breaking the role into micro-quests that build on each other:

1. Stack Recon & Diagnosis (no code yet)

Shadow one process in your own life or a friend’s business. Write the steps, tools, pain points.
Practice interviewing: grab a founder friend and ask “where do things bottleneck?” Record notes in a Notion template.
Output: a simple “constraint map” doc—you’ve now done the first third of the job without touching Zapier.
2. Build Tool Familiarity

Pick Zapier or Make and complete a single beginner tutorial: connect Google Forms → Airtable → email.
Clone a public Airtable base (CRM, content calendar) and customize it. Notice how fields link, how automations trigger.
Output: screenshot + Loom explaining what you built. Share it in NoCode Ops or Automation Hangout for feedback.
3. Automation Mini-Project

Automate something personal: maybe logging job leads from email into Airtable or sending yourself daily task summaries.
Track hours saved or frustration avoided.
Output: before/after write-up + metrics—this becomes a case study snippet.
4. Documentation & Enablement

Turn that mini-project into a 1-page SOP with steps, screenshots, failure checks.
Record a Loom training video walking a “client” through the automation.
Output: proves you can teach and support teams.
5. Monitoring & Iteration Practice

Purposefully break your automation, set up a simple alert (e.g., Zapier error emails), and fix it.
Document the incident and resolution.
Output: “Incident log” template you’ll reuse with clients.
Once you’ve cycled through these, you’ll have:

Hands-on experience with every stage in the breakdown.
A set of tangible artifacts (maps, Looms, SOPs, incident log) to show clients.
Confidence that the whole job is just these loops repeated at bigger scales.
When you’re ready, tackle a slightly larger project for a real business—maybe offer a $200 “Automation Triage” to a founder in your network. Use the templates above, and every engagement becomes more repeatable.

If you want, I can help you set up the next micro-quest (e.g., stack audit template, automation idea backlog). Just say which piece feels like the right starting point.

i feel like iwould need a much more through background wouldnt i? i cant imagine those are the only tools i need?


You’re right—the shortlist I rattled off is just the visible tip. A seasoned Systems Optimizer usually layers tools and disciplines from several buckets. Think of it as a skill tree you can climb gradually rather than prerequisites you must master upfront. Here’s a clearer map of what “full background” can look like:

Core Automation Stack (No-Code/Low-Code)

Primary orchestrators: Zapier, Make (Integromat), n8n.
Data hubs: Airtable, SmartSuite, Notion databases, Google Sheets.
Form/intake tools: Typeform, Tally, Paperform.
Scheduling & comms: Calendly, Slack workflows, Twilio/SendGrid for alerts.
Document automation: Google Docs/Slides APIs, Documint, PandaDoc.
Technical Glue

Webhooks & REST basics: how to catch/send payloads, authenticate with tokens.
JSON parsing and transformations (e.g., parsing nested arrays in Make).
Scripting when limits show up: lightweight JavaScript, Python, or Apps Script snippets.
Database familiarity: understanding when to move from Airtable to Postgres, Supabase, or Firestore.
Operational Foundations

Process analysis: value stream mapping, swimlanes, RACI charts, Theory of Constraints.
Change management: communication plans, training materials, stakeholder buy-in tactics.
Project management: scoping, Statements of Work, Kanban/Trello/Asana usage, status reporting.
Compliance awareness: handling PII, access controls, maintaining audit logs.
Observability & Reliability

Monitoring: error logging (Zapier task history, Make scenario logs), uptime monitors, status dashboards.
Incident response: playbooks for failures, backup plans, version control systems (Git, Notion changelogs).
Testing: sandbox environments, sample data sets, QA checklists before go-live.
Business & ROI Skills

Financial modeling: calculate hours saved, cost-per-automation vs. manual labor.
Pricing/packaging: audits vs. implementation vs. retainers.
Communication collateral: decks, Loom walkthroughs, SOP templates, client onboarding docs.
Legal basics: scopes, contracts, NDAs, data processing agreements.
Adjacent Specializations you can borrow as needed

Data analytics/BI (Looker Studio, Metabase) for insight dashboards.
CRM administration (HubSpot, Salesforce) if workflows touch sales pipelines.
Customer success tooling (Zendesk, Intercom, Help Scout).
E-commerce/marketing stacks (Shopify, Klaviyo, Webflow, ClickUp).
How to approach it without drowning:

Pick one lane per bucket (e.g., Zapier + Airtable + Loom for doc). Get comfortable before adding more.
Use real problems as tutors: build only what a client/user needs, and learn the required feature/tool on demand.
Partner or subcontract the deep stuff: If a job calls for heavy SQL or advanced scripting, bring in a specialist while you lead strategy and integration.
Document what you learn: Each new tool or technique becomes a reusable asset (SOP, template, snippet).
We can blueprint a learning roadmap—month-by-month milestones, projects to tackle, resources to follow. Or, if you want clarity on which tools matter for a specific niche (say, course creators vs. SaaS support), I can tailor a stack for that. Let me know your preference, and we’ll map it step by step.

can you make me a comprehensive etailed timetable plan that shows me the full who what when where why how of everything i have to learn and give me it in a logically coherent and natural order that also has the gentlest difficulty curve possible

i needed this as a document. also i dont have anyone to help me so i have no buddies


Drafted a standalone roadmap for you: career-paths/systems-optimizer-learning-roadmap.md. It lays out a 16‑week solo plan with a gentle difficulty curve—phase overview, week-by-week goals, daily rhythm, resource list, metrics dashboard, and post-plan next steps. Everything’s framed around what/why/how/when so you can work through it without needing a buddy. Let me know if you want the same treatment for another class or prefer this wired into the RPG UI.

can you now take systems-optimizer-learning-roadmap.md and Systems Optimizer Complete Learning Roadmap.md, read them both, then merge them so they are one document containing everything


Created career-paths/Systems Optimizer/systems-optimizer-master-roadmap.md with a two-part structure: Part I includes the full 16-week launch plan, and Part II embeds the 12-month comprehensive roadmap so every detail from both originals lives in one file.
Source documents left untouched; master file is ready for reading/exporting. Use this version for consolidated planning.
add thse things: This is an exceptionally well-structured roadmap! The level of detail, realistic timelines, and thoughtful scaffolding show real care. Here are some suggestions to make it even stronger:

Strengths Worth Keeping
The "gentle difficulty curve" philosophy is perfect for adult learners
Concrete time estimates and success criteria reduce ambiguity
The troubleshooting appendix addresses real psychological barriers
Jeff-specific advantages section personalizes the generic plan
Suggested Improvements
1. Add Failure Recovery Checkpoints
Currently, the roadmap assumes linear progress. Add explicit "pivot points":

### Week 4 Checkpoint: Should I Continue?
- If you haven't completed 3 working Zaps → Repeat Week 3
- If automations feel overwhelming → Drop to 1 hour/day pace
- If you're bored → Skip to Week 9 (personal projects) to see "why"
2. Strengthen the "Quick Win" Hook
Move a tangible personal benefit earlier:

Suggested reorder: Week 1 could include one 30-minute automation that saves the learner time that same day (e.g., "Auto-file email attachments to Drive"). This creates immediate reinforcement before theory-heavy weeks.

3. Clarify Tool Cost Escalation
The free tiers are great for learning, but add a section:

### Expected Tool Costs by Phase
- Months 1-3: $0 (free tiers)
- Months 4-6: ~$50/month (paid Zapier/Make)
- Months 7-12: ~$150/month (+ Airtable Pro, contractors)
- Pass costs to clients in proposals
4. Add "Energy Management" Guidance
You mention time budgets but not cognitive load:

### Weekly Energy Allocation
- **High-energy tasks (creative/building):** Tuesday-Thursday mornings
- **Medium-energy (testing/docs):** Weekday afternoons  
- **Low-energy (admin/email):** Friday, or when tired
- **Match task difficulty to your energy state**
5. Make Client Acquisition Less Linear
The current plan has "find client" in Week 14. Reality is messier:

Suggested approach:

Week 8: Start soft outreach ("building skills, who do you know with X problem?")
Week 10: Offer free audits to 3 people
Week 12: By now you should have 1-2 people saying "I'd pay for this"
Week 14: Formal engagement
This spreads relationship-building across months instead of a sudden "sales sprint."

6. Add "Productized Service" Template
Around Month 7-8, include a specific example:

### Example: "$2,500 Lead Management Package"
**Scope (fixed, 15 hours):**
- Lead capture form → Airtable
- Auto-routing by criteria
- Follow-up task creation
- Weekly digest email
- 1 revision round included

**Why this works:** Fixed scope = predictable delivery = scalable.
7. Strengthen the API Learning Curve
Week 4 (APIs) has a steep jump. Consider:

Add a "bridge week" using Zapier's Webhook tool before raw Postman
Show 3-4 graduated examples (read-only API → create record → update record)
Link to specific beginner-friendly APIs (Airtable, JSONPlaceholder, PokéAPI)
8. Add "Template Library" Earlier
Don't wait until Week 37. By Week 12, learners should start a personal library:

### Your Growing Arsenal (update weekly)
- **Zap Templates:** Lead capture, email parsing, etc.
- **Airtable Bases:** CRM, project tracker, content calendar
- **Documentation Templates:** SOP structure, audit report
- **Loom Scripts:** Training walkthrough outline
9. Include "Specialist vs. Generalist" Decision Framework
Week 28 has specialization, but add decision criteria:

### Specialization Decision Matrix
| Factor | Industry Vertical | Functional Area | Tool Specialist |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Market Size | Medium (need validation) | Large | Medium |
| Competition | Lower | Higher | Medium |
| Learning Curve | Steep (need domain knowledge) | Medium | Steep (deep tool mastery) |
| Pricing Power | High | Medium | High |
| Referral Ease | High (word spreads in industry) | Medium | Low |
10. Add "Psychological Landmarks"
Celebrate non-revenue milestones:

🎉 First automation that runs 30 days without breaking
🎉 First time a client says "This changed our business"
🎉 First unsolicited referral
🎉 First month you don't worry about pipeline
These matter more than dollar amounts sometimes.

11. Expand "When to Say No"
Add a decision tree for client red flags:

### 🚩 Client Red Flags Checklist
- [ ] Wants fixed price but scope keeps expanding → Renegotiate or walk
- [ ] Won't provide tool access or data → Can't deliver, decline
- [ ] Expects 24/7 support without retainer → Set boundaries or decline
- [ ] Describes previous consultants as "all idiots" → They'll say that about you too
- [ ] Massive scope, tiny budget, "exposure" payment → Hard pass
12. Add "Rest & Recovery" Explicit Schedule
The roadmap is intense. Add:

### Mandatory Rest Weeks
- **After Week 16:** 1 week off (process learnings)
- **After Month 6:** 1 week off (recharge before acceleration)
- **After Month 12:** 2 weeks off (celebrate, plan Year 2)

**Burnout kills more consulting careers than lack of skill.**
Structural Suggestions
A. Create a "Choose Your Own Adventure" Fork
After Month 3, offer paths:

Path A (Aggressive): Client-first, learn on the job → Month 4 revenue
Path B (Cautious): Skill-first, more practice → Month 6 revenue
Path C (Product): Build templates/course → Month 9 revenue
B. Add Video Walkthroughs
Consider recording:

"Week 1 Day 1 Kickoff" video (you walking through the first automation)
"Month 3 Checkpoint" video (what to expect, pep talk)
"Month 6 Midpoint" video (client work debrief)
This adds a "guide" presence to the solo journey.

C. Create Companion Airtable Base
Build a tracker with:

Weekly checklist (automations built, hours invested)
Client pipeline (contact, status, value)
Skills inventory (rate yourself 1-5 on each tool)
Revenue tracker (cumulative learning)
D. Add "Buddy System Optional Track"
Some people need accountability. Include:

Suggested weekly check-in format with accountability partner
Community post templates ("Week X done, here's what I learned")
"Study group" forming guide (how to find 2-3 others on same timeline)
Content Additions
Missing Topics to Consider Adding:
Legal/Business Setup (Month 4-5)

LLC vs. sole proprietor
Basic contract template
Insurance (E&O)
Tax withholding
Email Deliverability (Week 20)

Many automations send emails
SPF/DKIM basics
Avoiding spam filters
Database Normalization (Week 6)

Beyond Airtable basics
When to split tables
Data integrity concepts
Change Management (Month 7)

Automations succeed technically but fail organizationally
Getting teams to actually USE the automation
Training best practices
Security & Compliance (Month 9)

GDPR basics
Data privacy in automations
Handling client data responsibly
*Love the bones. Here are the highest-leverage edits I’d make, with exact drop-in blocks and where to put them. I’m avoiding overlap with Claude and focusing on operational resilience, safety, and conversion.
Punch-list of concrete upgrades
1) Add “Kill-Switch + Backout” to every build
Where: end of “Weeks 5–6: Personal Automation Sprint,” under How.
Why: Prevents runaway tasks and gives you a safe revert.

### Production Safety (add to every automation)
- **Kill-switch:** one toggle field (Airtable: `enabled:boolean`) checked in every flow
- **Backout:** documented manual path to the previous workflow
- **Rate limit guard:** throttle to N runs/min; fail closed on 429s
- **Dry-run mode:** log only, no write actions, for first 24 hours
2) Ship SLOs (not vibes)
Where: “Weeks 11–12: Monitoring & Reliability,” add a table under Outputs.

Metric	Target	Alert
Success rate (7-day)	≥ 99.0%	drop below 98%
Mean time to recover (MTTR)	< 2h	> 4h
False-positive notifications	< 5%	> 10%
Task spend / $1k saved	≤ $50	> $100
Add a weekly check: “If any SLO breached → create corrective action in Incident Log.”

3) Insert a Pre-Mortem + Red Team
Where: Week 9–10 “Advanced Integrations,” after How.

### Pre-Mortem (20 minutes)
- List 5 realistic failure modes (auth expiry, schema drift, API 429, malformed payload, human error)
- For each: prevention, detection, response

### Red Team (15 minutes)
- Try to break it: bad inputs, empty fields, oversized files, duplicate submissions
- Confirm alerts fire and rollback works
4) Make the “Quick Win” unavoidable (Day 1)
Where: Week 1 “Day 1–2: Concept Foundation,” add a same-day micro-automation before reading.

**Zero-to-Win (30 minutes)**
Trigger: New starred email → Action: save all attachments to Drive + reply “received”
Success: You see files in Drive and the bounce-back in Gmail within 5 minutes
5) Minimum Viable Stack (MVS) guardrails
Where: “0. Guiding Principles,” add a row.

Principle	What It Means	How You’ll Apply It
Minimum Viable Stack	Fewer tools → fewer failures	Prefer Zapier/Airtable until a requirement is impossible there; add Make/Python only for explicit gaps
Also add to Week 5 (“Make Fundamentals”): checklist “Prove it needs Make” (array ops, routers, per-run cost).

6) Portfolio Evidence Protocol
Where: Week 12 “Reflection & Documentation,” expand outputs.

### Evidence Pack (per system)
- 60-sec Loom teaser (client-friendly)
- Before/after screenshot pair (time saved callout)
- One chart: runs/day & error rate (past 7–14 days)
- ROI one-liner: “Saves ~X hrs/wk = ~$Y/mo”
This is what converts.

7) Cost Escalation + Capacity Model (simple)
Where: “Week 13–14: Packaging & Sales Assets,” add under How.

### Capacity & Pricing sanity check
- Weekly delivery capacity: 10–12 hrs
- Project math: (estimated hours × 1.6 buffer) × rate
- Tool burn forecast: Zapier tasks + Make ops at projected volume
- Floor price rule: never quote below 10% of first-year value saved
8) “Say No” as a flowchart (faster than prose)
Where: Appendices → Troubleshooting (“I don’t know what to charge / take”), add.

Client asks X → Is scope stable? 
  └─ No → Paid Audit first
  └─ Yes → Do I have 80% pattern match?
        └─ No → Partner or decline
        └─ Yes → Quote with 1.6× time buffer
Red flags (any 2) → decline with referral
9) Data Hygiene rules early (prevent downstream pain)
Where: Week 11–12 Monitoring OR Week 3–4 Tool Scouting; your call.

### Data Hygiene Defaults
- Required keys validated at intake (email, timestamp, ID)
- One canonical ID per entity; no natural keys
- Enum fields only for status; free text blocked
- Soft-delete column; never hard-delete in production
10) Add a tiny “Compliance Baseline”
Where: Month 9 (Security & Compliance is hinted in Appendices; make it explicit in Phase 5).

### Compliance Baseline (small-shop edition)
- PII map: where emails/phones live; who can access
- Access policy: least privilege; remove access at offboarding
- Secrets rotation: change API keys quarterly
- Data retention: 12 months logs; 30-day backups
- Email deliverability: SPF/DKIM verified on sender domain
11) “Choose Your Path” as a 15-sec self-test
Where: After Month 3 recap (PHASE 2), right before PHASE 3.

### 15-Second Fork
- Crave momentum? → Path A: Client-first (revenue Month 4)
- Crave mastery? → Path B: Skill-first (revenue Month 6)
- Crave assets? → Path C: Product (revenue Month 9)
Commit for 8 weeks; re-evaluate once.
(You already gesture at this later; moving a micro-fork earlier reduces churn.)

12) Energy routing (tactical)
Where: “3. Weekly Rhythm Template,” add an energy map row.

Day	Focus	Energy Note
Tue–Thu AM	Build	protect deep work; mute notifications
Afternoons	Docs/QA	medium energy
Fri	Admin/Outreach	low energy; batching only
13) Client Handoff “3-Up, 3-Down”
Where: Week 16 “Training & Handoff.”

At handoff: list 3 things the system does *well* and 3 *known limits/assumptions*. Aligns expectations and reduces surprise tickets.
14) Add “Schema Drift Watch”
Where: Week 11–12.

Nightly check that source schemas (headers/fields) match last known schema; alert on diff; write diff to “Schema Changes” table.
15) Template Library—move it forward
You already build templates in Month 8–9. Start the library in Week 8 and require “one new template per week” thereafter. Label: ready, needs-polish, retired.

Small copy tweaks (tighten outcomes)
Week 5–6 check: change “Track hours saved for two weeks” → “Log hours saved daily; publish before/after in Evidence Pack (see §6).”
Week 14 outreach: add “stop rule”—if zero replies after 20 sends, rewrite the opener around a quantified observation.
Pricing ladders: everywhere that says “pricing that makes you nervous,” also anchor to value: “price ≥ 10% of first-year savings or walk.”
What this gives you
Fewer breakages (kill-switch, schema watch, SLOs)
Faster proof for sales (Evidence Packs)
Cleaner scope control (pre-mortem, say-no flowchart)
Less cognitive drag (MVS rule, energy routing)
If you want, I can make a one-page insert (“Safety & SLO Addendum”) you can paste into every client packet.


Added a new “Feedback Snapshot & Upgrade Plan” up top so you keep the praise plus a quick map of improvement themes.
Extended the Launch Plan with zero-day quick win, MVS principle, Week 4 checkpoint, early outreach, template library start, tool-cost forecast, productized offer template, capacity math, safety tooling (kill switch, pre-mortem, red-team, schema watch, SLO table), evidence packs, and pipeline follow-ups.
Wove in energy management guidance, rest-week cadence, psychological milestones, choose-your-own-path fork, and a red-flag decision flow so the roadmap now covers resilience, pacing, and client qualification.
Updated Weeks 9–12 for API scaffolding and monitoring rigor, and tightened Week 13–14 checks with a rewrite rule if outreach flops.
Next idea: mirror key safety/energy sections into Part II’s monthly plan or build the Airtable tracker hinted in the doc so execution stays on rails.

elaborate


Context: you asked for a richer, safer, gentler roadmap. I expanded the master document so it now includes:

Meta feedback section near the top, keeping the praise and listing improvement themes (recovery points, early wins, costs, energy, safety, client pipeline, assets).
Guiding principles gained a “Minimum Viable Stack” rule to stop tool sprawl until it’s justified.
In the 16-week launch plan I added:

Zero-day quick win (auto-save email attachments) and a Week 4 checkpoint with branches if you’re stuck, overwhelmed, or bored.
Production safety defaults for every automation (kill switch, dry run, rate-limit guard, backout plan).
Data hygiene rules in Week 3–4.
Template library starting Week 7, plus “early outreach” ping and follow-up loops (Week 8 soft outreach, Week 9–10 free audits, Week 11–12 pipeline check).
API red-team/pre-mortem and a bridge sequence so the jump to webhooks doesn’t feel abrupt—plus sample APIs to practice on.
Monitoring upgrades: schema drift watch, an SLO table with alert triggers, and an Evidence Pack (Loom, before/after, chart, ROI line) to help you sell.
Energy allocation chart in the weekly rhythm; spelled out rest weeks, psychological milestones, and client red-flag flow.
Tool cost forecast and capacity/pricing sanity check in Weeks 13–14, plus a ready-made $2.5K productized offer template.
Outreach stop rule: rewrite opener if 20 messages flop.
15-second fork after Week 16 to choose aggressive/steady/product routes, followed by mandatory rest windows.
Appendices now highlight “say no” logic and celebration triggers; the red-flag checklist lives next to the fork section so you catch bad-fit clients early.

Part II (the 12-month roadmap) retains its structure but inherits the new context from Part I. Let me know if you want me to propagate the same safety/energy notes into the monthly phases or build the companion Airtable tracker hinted inside.

wha is thi airtable tracker


When the roadmap mentions a “companion Airtable base,” it’s pointing to a lightweight control centre you can build to track everything the plan asks you to log—skills, builds, outreach, revenue—without juggling loose notes. Think of it as your in-world quest log.

Here’s the structure I recommend (you can spin this up in Airtable or copy the schema into Notion if you prefer):

Tables

Weeks & Sprints

Fields: Week #, Focus, Start Date, Hours Planned, Hours Actual, Status (Planned/In Progress/Done/Blocked), Highlights, Energy Rating, SLO Breaches?.
Use: Tick the roadmap boxes, journal blockers, keep a one-glance progress bar.
Automations

Fields: Automation Name, Client/Self, Purpose, Stack (Zapier/Make etc), Kill Switch Implemented?, Dry Run Date, Go Live Date, Hours Saved/wk, SLO Metrics (Success%, MTTR, Cost), Evidence Pack Asset Links.
Use: Catalog every build with proof of impact and safety info.
Templates & Assets

Fields: Asset Name, Type (Zap Template, Airtable Base, SOP, Loom Script), Status (ready, needs polish, retired), Last Updated, Notes, Share Link.
Use: Keeps your library organised as the roadmap now asks.
Outreach & Pipeline

Fields: Contact, Source, Stage (Idea/Intro/Audit/Proposal/Won/Lost), Offer, Next Action, Reminder Date, Quote Value, Outcome Notes.
Use: Spreads the relationship building across weeks (Weeks 8–12 prompts).
Financials

Fields: Invoice #, Client, Service Package, Hours Worked, Quoted Price, Actual Price, Tool Costs Allocated, Received?, Notes.
Use: Aligns with the capacity/pricing sanity checks.
Skills Inventory

Fields: Skill, Category (Automation, API, Change Management, etc.), Self-Rating (1–5), Evidence, Last Practiced, Planned Next Improvement.
Use: track where you feel weak, tie into rest weeks and specialty decisions.
Views

Week progress Kanban (by Status).
Automation safety dashboard (filter Kill Switch Implemented? = No).
Pipeline board (staged funnel).
Revenue vs. tool cost chart.
If you want, I can draft the Airtable base (CSV schema or API import) so you can one-click create it. Let me know and I’ll spin up the template structure with sample rows to jumpstart it.

okay make it


Added a ready-to-import tracker under career-paths/Systems Optimizer/tracker/.
CSV tables: weeks_and_sprints, automations, templates_and_assets, pipeline, financials, skills_inventory.
Each ships with sample data plus safety/SLO fields aligned with the roadmap.
Dropped a README.md explaining how to load each file into Airtable (or any spreadsheet) and which views to build (status Kanban, safety filter, pipeline board, revenue vs. tool cost chart, skills radar).
Next move: drag these CSVs into a new Airtable base, link views as suggested, and start logging Week 1 progress.

what exactly is airtable


Airtable is a cloud database app that feels like a spreadsheet but behaves like a lightweight relational database. You build “bases” made up of tables (like Excel sheets), but each column has a field type—text, attachments, checkboxes, links to other tables, formulas, etc. That structure lets you do things spreadsheets struggle with: relate contacts to projects, filter by status, add checkboxes that trigger automations, view the same data as grids, Kanban boards, calendars, or forms.

For this roadmap, Airtable works well because:

Structured tracking: your weekly plan, automations, pipeline, and skills all live in separate tables you can link together.
Views & filtering: instant Kanban by status, a “show me automations without kill switches” filter, or a chart for revenue vs. tool costs.
Automation ready: later, you can hook Airtable into Zapier/Make to auto-create tasks, send reminders, or update dashboards.
Interfaces: newer Airtable “Interfaces” let you build a simple control panel without leaving the tool.
It’s free for small projects; paid plans unlock attachments, automation runs, and advanced permissions—hence the cost notes in the roadmap.
