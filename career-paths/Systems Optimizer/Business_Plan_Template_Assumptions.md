## Executive Summary
- Positioning: We eliminate the #1 operational bottleneck for SMBs and agencies, delivering ≥5x ROI via constraint‑first automation in ≤30 days.
- Targets (12–18 months): $10K–$15K/month run‑rate by Month 12–18; 3–5 case studies; 2–3 active retainers; first $10K+ project by Month 12–18.
- Offers: Audit ($750–$1,500), Implementation Sprint ($2,500–$7,000), Retainer ($1,500–$5,000/mo), Emergency ($200/hr), add‑ons (API, dashboards, migrations).
- Runway: Bootstrapped with 3–6 months living expenses reserved; tools scale from $0 (Months 1–3) to ~$50–$150/mo (Months 4–12) as volume grows.

## ICP & Problem Hypotheses
- ICPs:
  - SMBs (5–50 employees; $500K–$5M revenue; ops or founder‑led; Zapier/Google Workspace/CRM sprawl; budget $2K–$10K/project).
  - Marketing agencies (10–100 employees; recurring reporting needs; budget $3K–$15K/project).
  - Seed‑to‑Series A SaaS (20–200 employees; onboarding/support workflows; budget $5K–$20K/project).
- Top pains: manual data entry (10+ hrs/wk), disconnected tools (10+ apps), slow follow‑up (lead leakage), manual reporting (8+ hrs/wk).
- Buying triggers: headcount freeze, missed SLAs, new tool adoption, audit findings, leadership changes.
- Objections: fear of fragility, vendor lock‑in, unclear ROI; counter with SLOs, rollback plans, ROI calculator, and 30‑day stabilization.

## Positioning & UVP
- Value proposition: “Constraint‑First Automation that pays for itself in 90 days.”
- Proof points: 2‑week delivery sprints; documentation excellence (SOPs, Looms, dashboards); measurable ROI (time saved × hourly cost); optional partner certifications.
- Differentiators: bottleneck‑first scope, reliability SLOs, productized offers with fixed outcomes, evidence pack per project.

## Market Analysis
- Demand signals: steady SMB adoption of no‑/low‑code automation; healthy marketplace lead flow for Zapier/Make/Airtable projects in the $1.5K–$7K range; retainers common at $1.5K–$5K/mo.
- Competitive landscape: Zapier Experts/Make Partners, freelance generalists, IT integrators; fragmented market with specialization opportunities (RevOps, client reporting, lead routing, onboarding).
- SWOT (summary):
  - Strengths: clear ROI framing, tight scope offers, strong documentation.
  - Weaknesses: initial credibility, limited bandwidth early on.
  - Opportunities: niche specialization (agencies, CRM hygiene, reporting), AI‑assisted QA.
  - Threats: platform pricing changes, API deprecations, marketplace fee shifts.

## Offer Ladder & Pricing
- Audit ($750–$1,500): interviews, workflow maps, 5–10 opportunities, ROI and roadmap.
- Implementation Sprint ($2,500–$7,000): 5–12 automations, monitoring, docs, training, 30–60 days support.
- Retainer ($1,500–$5,000/mo): monitoring, monthly optimizations, 1–2 new automations/month, 4‑hour response.
- Emergency ($200/hr): urgent fixes and recovery.
- Add‑ons: API ($150/hr), dashboards ($1K–$2.5K), workshops ($500–$1.5K), migrations ($2K–$5K).
- Guardrails: quote ≥10% of first‑year client savings; change‑order for scope drift; minimum project $2,000 once portfolio established.

## Marketing & Sales Strategy
- Channels: 
  - Outbound: 15–20 targeted emails/week; founder‑led outreach to ops leaders and agency owners.
  - Content: weekly teardown/tutorial; 1 case study per month; LinkedIn distribution.
  - Marketplaces: presence on Codemap/Upwork; qualify for Zapier Expert/Make Partner.
  - Partnerships: bookkeepers, RevOps shops, marketing agencies; simple referral terms.
- Sales process: discovery (pains, stack, data), ROI calc (hrs saved × loaded rate), proposal within 48 hours; proposal templates with clear scope and SLOs.
- 90‑day experiments: A/B outreach angles; 4 content formats; compare marketplace vs. partnership CAC; success thresholds (≥3 SQLs/week, ≥25% proposal win rate).

## Delivery & Quality
- Workflow: Audit → Prioritized constraint → Micro‑win build → Full sprint → Test → Train → Handoff → 30‑day stabilize → Optional retainer.
- Tooling: Zapier/Make + Airtable + Notion; add APIs/Python only when necessary; monitoring dashboard per client.
- SLOs: success rate ≥99.0% (7‑day), MTTR < 2 hours, false‑positive notifications < 5%, backup/rollback < 2 hours.
- Governance: validate keys at intake; canonical IDs; enums for statuses; soft‑delete; nightly schema drift checks; incident log with corrective actions.

## Operating Model & Organization
- Capacity assumptions (solo): 25–30 billable hrs/week at maturity; utilization target 60%+; weekly buffers for sales and R&D.
- Roles: founder (architecture/build), fractional QA/monitoring (as needed), rostered contractors for surge capacity.
- Subcontracting: $40–$60/hr junior builders under $120/hr bill rate; code review and SOP adherence required.

## Financial Model
- Rate card: effective billable target $85–$120/hr via packages.
- Revenue ramp (illustrative):
  - Months 1–3: $0–$500/mo (portfolio, testimonials).
  - Months 4–6: $1K–$3K/mo (2–3 projects @ $500–$1.5K).
  - Months 7–12: $5K–$10K/mo (3–5 projects @ $2K–$4K + 1–2 retainers @ $2K/mo).
- Costs: tools $0 (M1–3) → ~$50–$150/mo (M4–12); marketing $150–$500/mo starting M4; insurance ~$500–$1,500/yr; CPA $600–$1,200/yr.
- Tax set‑aside: 25%–30% of net income; quarterly estimates.
- Break‑even: recover initial learning hours and tools by Week 12–16 at ≥$85/hr effective rate and 15 billable hrs/week.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Demand variability → diversify channels; maintain 60‑day pipeline.
- Platform changes → multi‑tool proficiency; export/backup routines; version pinning.
- Skill gaps → scheduled R&D sprints; targeted micro‑projects.
- Client churn → QBR cadence, roadmap backlog, small continuous wins.
- Compliance/data risk → DPA templates, access controls, incident response drills.

## Capital Plan (Bootstrapping)
- Minimal viable spend: free tiers M1–3; scale to paid plans as usage increases.
- Reserve: 3–6 months living expenses; $1K–$2K working capital for tools/marketing.
- Insurance: professional liability and cyber once billing >$2K/mo.

## Milestones & KPIs
- Pipeline: 10–15 conversations/week; 3+ proposals/week; ≥25% win rate.
- Delivery: 2–4 projects/month (early), 1–2 retainers by Month 8; SLO compliance ≥98%.
- Financial: first $5K month by Month 7–10; first $10K month by Month 12–18; gross margin ≥60%.
- Evidence: 3 case studies by Month 6; 5 by Month 12 with quantified ROI.
