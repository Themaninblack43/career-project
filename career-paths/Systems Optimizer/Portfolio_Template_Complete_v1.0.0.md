# [Your Name] - Systems Optimizer

> Helping businesses eliminate manual workflows through strategic automation

---

## 👋 About Me

I'm a Systems Optimizer specializing in business process automation. I help small-to-medium businesses eliminate manual workflows and operational bottlenecks using no-code automation tools.

### My Approach

I use **constraint theory** to identify and automate the #1 bottleneck first, delivering maximum ROI from Day 1. Rather than automating everything, I focus on the single point of highest leverage that unlocks the most value.

### Background

- **Technical Skills:** Zapier, Make (Integromat), Airtable, APIs, workflow design

### What Makes Me Different

- **Constraint-First Methodology:** Identify the bottleneck, automate it first
- **ROI Transparency:** Every project includes time and cost savings calculations
- **Documentation Excellence:** Comprehensive handoff materials and training
- **Business Focus:** I solve business problems, not just connect tools

## 🔨 Projects & Case Studies

### Project 1: [Gmail Starred Email Tracker]

**Category:** Personal Practice  
**Tools Used:** Zapier, Gmail, Google Sheets  
**Date Completed:** [October 18, 2025]  
**Build Time:** 1 hour

#### The Problem

[Describe the manual process that was inefficient]

Example:
> I was starring important emails in Gmail to follow up later, but had no organized way to track them. Emails would get buried, and I'd lose track of important follow-ups. I was spending 5 minutes per day manually reviewing starred emails and deciding what to do next.

**Time wasted:** 30+ hours per year

#### The Solution

[Describe what you built and how it works]

Example:
> I built an automation that captures every starred email to a Google Sheet automatically, creating an organized tracking system with zero manual work.
> 
> **How it works:**
> 1. Star an email in Gmail (2 seconds)
> 2. Zapier detects the starred email within 15 minutes
> 3. Automatically extracts: sender, subject, date, body preview, link
> 4. Adds new row to Google Sheet
> 5. Can now track status, add notes, mark as complete

#### The Results

- ⏱️ **Time Saved:** 5 minutes/day = 30 hours/year
- 💰 **Value:** $1,500/year (at $50/hour rate)
- 📈 **Impact:** Zero emails lost, better follow-up rate, clear priorities

#### Technical Details

**Trigger:** New Starred Email in Gmail
- Checks every 15 minutes for newly starred emails
- Only captures emails starred after automation was created

**Action:** Create Spreadsheet Row in Google Sheets
- Maps email fields to sheet columns:
  - Date Starred → Column A
  - From (sender) → Column B
  - Subject → Column C
  - Body (first 200 chars) → Column D
  - Email Link → Column E
  - Status (manual) → Column F

**Error Handling:** Built-in Zapier retry mechanism

#### Screenshots

[Add 3-5 screenshots here:]
1. Automation configuration in Zapier
2. Data mapping setup
3. Google Sheet with results
4. Zap History showing successful runs
5. (Optional) Before/after comparison

#### Lessons Learned

[What you learned building this]

Example:
> 1. **Deployment is automatic** - "Publish" in Zapier = live deployment
> 2. **Free plan delay** - 15-minute check interval on free plan
> 3. **Data mapping is critical** - Ensuring correct fields mapped to correct columns
> 4. **Testing is essential** - Starred multiple test emails before relying on it

#### Client Application

[How this applies to business problems]

Example:
> This same pattern applies to business problems:
> - **Sales teams:** Capture leads from form submissions to CRM
> - **Support teams:** Log support emails to tracking system
> - **Operations:** Track vendor communications automatically
> 
> **Potential client value:** If a sales team of 5 people saves 30 minutes/day each, that's $39,000/year in labor savings.
